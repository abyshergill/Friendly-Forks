| Project Name         | Information |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| [Lucas_Mulitselect_Web_App](https://github.com/abyshergill/Friendly-Forks/tree/main/Lucas_Mulitselect_Web_App)  | The Lucas web application addresses the inefficiency of sharing large Excel files among multiple users by providing a centralized solution for data filtering and access. Users can upload a single Excel file to a virtual machine, and then anyone with access can filter, view, and download the data without needing to share the large file itself. This improves efficiency and is especially beneficial for older systems with limited memory that may struggle with large Excel files.
| [Wai_Multiselect_Dropdown_Login_Web_App](https://github.com/abyshergill/Friendly-Forks/tree/main/Wai_Multiselect_Dropdown_Login_Web_App)  | The Wai web application addresses the inefficiency of sharing large Excel files among multiple users by providing a centralized solution for data filtering and access. Only user with ID and password can upload a single Excel file to a virtual machine, and then anyone with access can filter, view, and download the data without needing to share the large file itself. This improves efficiency and is especially beneficial for older systems with limited memory that may struggle with large Excel files.
